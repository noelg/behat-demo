#Behat demo

My little demo application to play around with Behat.
I am not involved or connected to anybody at Behat. I am just a user :)

## Usage

1. Change into the directory of this app.

2. Get [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) and run `composer install`

3. Download Selenium Standalone Server from <http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list> and put it into the `/selenium` folder.

4. Start Selenium server with the correct version number:

	```
    java -jar selenium/selenium-server-standalone-x.xx.x.jar
	```

5. Open a new console window and run this command:

	```
    bin/behat
	```
